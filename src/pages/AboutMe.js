        Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am a Software Engineer currently working with
        BrowserStack ðŸš€. In the day I am a Software Engineer and in the night I
        am an open source contributor and like to contribute to technologies
        that shows impact and make everyones lives a bit less hard. Along with
        working on my day job i am also part of the team that maintains the
        NodeJS core project.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 md:relative">
        My current tech stack is primarily based on NodeJS but in the past i
        have worked with Python based web-framworks (Django and Flask), NodeJS
        based web frameworks (NestJS and Express) and also worked with mobile
        technologies like Flutter along with native android development as well.
        Had a taste with frontend technologies as well like React to fuel all
        that logic in a presentable manner.
